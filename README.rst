Overview
========

Whole Tale is a scalable, web-based, multi-user platform for the creation, publication, and execution of "tales" -- shareable, reproducible, and preservable research objects that capture data, code, and the complete execution environment required for reproducibility. Whole Tale is intended to enable researchers to publish interactive environments along with research data used in published research.  A beta version of the Whole Tale reference implementation is available at https://dashboard.wholetale.org.
