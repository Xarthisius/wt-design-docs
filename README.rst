What is Whole Tale?
-------------------

Whole Tale is an NSF-funded Data Infrastructure Building Block (DIBBS)
initiative to build a scalable, web-based, multi-user platform enabling the 
creation, publication, and execution of "tales" -- shareable, reproducible, 
and preservable research objects that capture data, code, and the complete 
execution environment required for reproducibility. Whole Tale is intended 
to enable researchers to publish interactive environments along with code
and data used in published research to support evaluation and re-execution.

A beta version of the Whole Tale platform is available at
https://dashboard.wholetale.org.  


- If you are interested in exploring the Whole Tale service, please see the :ref:`User Guide <users-guide>`.

Why Whole Tale?
---------------

The Whole Tale platform is being developed to contribute to and simplify the
adoption of practices that improve the understandability and reproducibility of
published research based on computational environments. 

Societies/Communities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Academic societies, associations and communities are responding to challenges in
the reproducibility of published research by adopting recommendations,
guidelines, and policies that impact publishers, editors, and researchers.
Communities are beginning to adopt practices encouraging or requiring 
sharing of code and data. Some are even implementing verification and evaluation
processes to confirm the reprodubility of published work. 

Editors
^^^^^^^

In response to the demand of academic communities to address problems of
reproducibility and reuse, journal editors are increasingly adopting guidelines
and enforcing policies for the sharing of data, code and information about the
software environment used in published research based on computational analysis.

Researchers 
^^^^^^^^^^^

Researchers are increasingly adopting practices to improve the transparency and
reproducibility of their own computational research.  Some are self-motivated to
improve their own rigor and transparency while others are responding to the
demands and requirements of  academic communities and journals.  Some are
advanced tool users with sophisticated methods of packaging and distributing
scientific software, often with automated testing and verification. Others are
more concerned with the research product than learning new tools and 
infrastructure for sharing and transparency.

Curators and Reviewers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The scholarly publication process has built-in mechanisms for anonymous peer
review. Some communities are adopting replication practices to ensure that
published research can be replicated at various levels. Anonymous reviewers and
curators of research artifacts play an important role in the quality of research
artifacts.

Repository Developers and Operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Developers and operators of research data repositories are faced with the
challenge of addressing the needs of their communities through support for new
types of scholarly objects, methods of access, and processes for review and
verification.


What is a Tale?
---------------
A "tale" is a new type of preservable research object that combines data, software,
and narrative into a single re-runnable, publishable, and verifiable package:

     :align: center
     :scale: 70%

A Tale consists of the following:

- A software environment used to create and run your analysis (e.g., RStudio,
  Jupyter)
- A workspace folder for your code, narrative, and documentation.
- A data folder with optional references to externally published datasets.


Whole Tale is an ongoing NSF-funded Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBS) project initiated in 2016 with expected completion February, 2021.
