This document is to keep track of what metadata is automatically generated by the Whole Tale system, and what the default values are. This is relevant to publishing tales on DataONE.


System Metadata Generation
--------------------------

Any files that don't already exist on DataONE need to have system metadata documents generated. In every case where a package is created & uploaded to DataONE, system metadata will be generated for at least

  1. The EML Metadata
  2. The Resource Map

PID
^^^

The PID of the metadata document will be generated on the Whole Tale Side as a uuid4.

Rights Holder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The rights holder typically corresponds to a user's orcid ID. Right now this is hard-coded and will be addressed with Globus-DataONE integration.

Dates
^^^^^

The date of metadata generation is required, which will be set to the current date and time at which the metadata generation code it hit.


Access Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The metadata document hold information about who can access the data. By default, this is set to public and to read permissions.


Minimum EML Generation
----------------------

When uploading the package, a minimum EML record is required. This will/can be edited by the user at another step later in the process. The minimum record has documents the following

  1. The Title. This is set as the tale title
  2. The ``surName`` of the ``individualName`` in the ``creator`` field. This is currently set as the 
     ``lastName`` of the user.
  3. The ``surName`` of the ``individualName`` in the ``creator`` field. This is currently set as the 
     ``lastName`` of the user.
  4. A ``dataTable`` entry for each file. This includes the ``entityName``, ``entityDescription``, ``objectName``, and ``size``.
