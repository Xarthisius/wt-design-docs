Agenda
------
* Updates
* Issue triage
  * Can't move or rename things in Data
    * Move not a blocker, but shouldn't support it if it doesn't work
    * Rename is an anoyance
  * Rename is weird
  * Data/Home/Workspace dirs visible after login
    * Needs to be fixed 
  * Kyles feedback:
      * "Manage" doesn't indicate that this is where I start to work with data
      * Environment panel doesn't make sense -- add text
      * Asynchronous event messages are hard to understand. "Loading data...Finished"
  * https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/191
    * Copy still not working (download copy fails)
      * Should be catching the error
    * Rename broken in some cases
    * Needs to be fix
  * Add text to register modal
    * https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/198
    * Remove/hide box
    * Already in newui, but need to confirm this is how we want to do it
    * Needs to be in v0.4
  * Register page
    * DataONE DOIs don't work
      * doi:10.18739/A23N20D37 
    * "Error Registering Object [Object object]"
    * Example DOIs that don't work
        * doi:10.18739/A2HT2GB23
        * doi:10.18739/A28C9R37P
    * Need to understand and document why these specific cases are failing for v0.4
  *  Manage page doesn't refresh
    *  https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/180
    *  Needs to be fixed in v0.4
  *  Can't copy data from "Data" to home to modify
    *  Copy behavior is immediate (copy to)
    *  Move fails
  *  Compose
    *  Clicking over name doesn't select item although hand is present
  *  Spinner spins forever: we need repeatable case
  *  TAle doesn't use full iframe 
    * Add issue, would like to see fixed in v0.4  
  *  Kyle sees 12 "another test" tales, but is almost certain he only created one
    * All are crazy when starting
    * Need to look into this to understand what's happening 
  *  View tale
    *  Edit button on illustratoin
* In summary, which issues do we need to fix before release?
  * Tale doesn't use full iframe (new issue)
  * If possible, identify what's happening with Kyle's account (12 another test tales)
  * Fix or disable "move" from Data to Home. Move doesn't make sense, so this should be copy
  * Manage page doesn't refresh after adding data https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/180
  * Identify and document why some DOIs won't register
  * Data/Home/Workspace dirs visible after login
  * Context menu errors https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/191
  * Add text to register modal https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/180
