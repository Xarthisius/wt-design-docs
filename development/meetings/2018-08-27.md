Agenda
------
* Updates
    * Blocker: Tommy can't deploy gwvolman
* Discussion of tale publishing
    * Q. Is there value in publishing a tale to DataONE that can't be re-executed in WT?
        * TT: Technically they can re-execute as long as they haven't deleted the tale in WT
        * BM: Yes, there is value in publishing even if it's not re-runnable
* v0.5 release (!?)
    * Publish to DataONE
        * File picker (initial implementation done, but there are bugs):
            * CW: I can select from home? None of my originally selected files are selected?
            * TT: Styling issues; subfolder selection (#247, #248)
        * Authentication:
            * CW: Seeing old auth flow. TT: It's on branch.
        * Run page
            * CW: Publish from Run page not visible. TT: On same branch as auth.
        * Integration with gwvolman (publish as Job)
            * TT: blocked by gwvolman build and deployment and possibly Celery error/version problem
        * Testing:
            * TT: Document test cases #18, #19, #20, #21
            * TT: Removed unit-tests from girder-wholetale, but there is no unit testing in gwvolman
* Other
    * Need to finalize requirements for tale publishing (Kacper?)
    * Celery on dev is 4.2.1
* Bryce has questions about workshop
