2018-10-25: PI review of UI/UX 
==============================

Kacper, Craig, Matt J, Matt T, Kyle 

UI/UX Meeting Notes

* MJ/MT: Directory structures should match in the UI and in the interface
    * This might break existing tales, but we can migrate (or mitigate now)
* MJ: 
    * People have struggled with home
    * If Workspace is where you should write results, we want to set that as the default folder when entering the environment
    * MT: Workspace as cwd
        * Users would need to .. for home and external_data
    * MJ: 
        * Bryce argued that we shouldn't have home at all
        * MT: xdgconfig home
    * MJ:
        * cwd as workspace
        * home contains workspace 
        * workspace contains external data
    * KK:
        * cwd set to workspace
        * two special directories
            * data
            * home
    * KC: 
        * supports hiding home and allowing people to mount if they need to
        * cwd should be workspace
        * hasn't heard concrete case for home other than RC files
        * MT: this is the only think you can mount on the desktop
            * This is the easiest way to get data into the system
            * We can still dump stuff into it
            * But it doesn't need to be
* MJ: Can we do this incrementally?
    * Interact is Run
    * Files is just the Run/Data
    * We want to get the directory structures right in the context of the current interface
* Copy on Launch

Google drive analogy
* Default console application  (Cloud9/Jupyter/Monaco/etfc)
* Home is just a particular tale
* Blessed Whole Tale console
* Use case:
    * I use just one environment

Webdav/
* Each workspace is a webdav 

Priorities:
* Revised Run/Data panel to behave more like Kristina's mockup
* Decision on directory structure and cwd
    * Options
        * home > workspace > data (nested)
            * cwd workspace
            * Since we create the workspace, we enforce the structure
        * Siblings home, workspace, external_data
            * cwd ..
        * workspace > 
            * data
            * home
            * cwd workspace
        * workspace > data
            * /mnt/home/xxx (buried home)
            * cwd workspace
        * workspace > data, home as sibling
            * cwd workspace
    * Example (workspaces in home)
        * home
            * My Water Tale (cwd)
                * data
        * Webdav
            * Ligo Tale
            * My Water Tale
        * * Users tried to write to cwd
* Best option
    * workspace contains data
    * cwd is workspace
    * home sibling to workspace, but accessible via environment (which may pose problems per environment)



Conflicting notions:
* Home as $HOME where my vimrc and bashrc live
    * We can't do this
* "Home" as  a personal space where I just put shared stuff across tale and can mount it via Webdav
    * Stop calling it home
    * "My Stuff"
    * POSIX filesystem, must be mounted somewhere and evident to the user.


Review of Rstudio cloud
* /home/rstudio-user is separate from /cloud/project
    * This could be a $HOME directory
* /workspace /workspace/data solves the problem of relative paths forever


Revision of Run/Data panel:
* Ceases to be picker
* Needs to show reality of mounted data

Option: Implement "Files" tab on Run page as workspace with data only (no home)
* Manage continues to be global (home/ global data)
* Run is tale sensitive
* Q. Does UI reflect env perfectly -- i.e., posix-style -- or separate workspace/data into two panels per mockup
* Actions for external data and worspace are different
    * Data = register/select from catalog
