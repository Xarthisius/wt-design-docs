2018-10-31: UI/UX task prioritization
=====================================
Adam, Damian, Mike, Kacper, Craig

Agenda:
* UI/UX 2018/2019 task prioritization and estimation

Priorities
----------
* Tale workspaces
* Tale-specific data selection
* Copy on launch/refactor Browse
* Compose modal
* Edit/view tale metadata
* Implement "Home" in Run > Files
* Extend "external_data" to support move/rename
* Add Browse/Environments
* Add Browse/Catalog


ND Availability
---------------
* IT: There's ~ 5 weeks of work for #1 and #2
* ND has lots of deliverables/demos in the coming weeks
* Ideally, Adam/Damian available in early December
* Now working in 1 week sprints
* Adam has done most of the file/folder work
* Even if someone just puts together the templates, we could later add the main logic. 

Ramping up Mike
---------------
* Compose modal or edit/view metadata might be a better place to start.
* Michael could start getting familiarized with HandleBars maybe?
* Component model is more challenging

Defining tasks
--------------
* Get them into smartsheet as a high-level overview
* Additional meetings for detailed task estimation 



Tale Workspace support
----------------------
* Add tab component to "Run" View
* Add "Interact" tab (current iframe + popout)
* Add "Files" tab (this is the Tale Workspace)
* Supported actions: create folder, rename folder/files, upload files
  * Workspace folder already exists on Backend
  * Allows same operations as Home, so similar functionality as current file browser. Will need to call API to get folder from Tale ID
* Update publish to use workspace
* Rough estimate: 3 weeks 1 FTE


Tale-specific data selection
----------------------------
* This work will replace current Run/Data panel
* Implement "Select Data" modal to select from catalog including other tales
    * See also mockups in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pl9FwVNeXyVVTccXLoTIeXsViWflbPpoQ5DLY44g5cw/edit#
    * Assume data is pre-registered Global via current Manage/Data (no DOi/HTTP tab until)
    * User can browse available datasets to select files/folders from the catalog from global catalog or existing Tales that they have access to
    * Files folders are added/removed to session (not checkbox)
        * /api/v1/dm/session
        * /api/v1/dm/session/{id}/add (not implemented)
        * /api/v1/dm/session/{id}/remove (not implemented)
    * User should be able to traverse/browse
    * Ideally multiple-selection
* Add "external_data" to new Run/Files tab
    * Since session API does not support full tree traversal, UI should only allow add/remove (not traversal or subselection)
    * Supported actions
        * Add data to session (depends on "Select Data" modal and session API)
        * Remove data from session
* Rough estimate:
    * Select data modal                1 week 1 FTE
    * External data tab (add/remove)   1 week 1 FTE


Refactor Browse to support "Copy on Launch"
-------------------------------------------
* Add support for All/My "tab" (remove filter?)
   * "All" shows all "public" tales
   * "My" shows all tales I have access to including
       - Tales created by me (eventually shared with me)
       - Copies of Tales I have run
       - Note: conflates Tales and instances (running/not running)
* Selecting tale from "All" 
   * Makes a copy, opens it (i.e., Run page); for now, does not launch
* Refactor cards (smaller images, ownership, copy, stopped/started)
* Add stop/start buttons/state to cards including spinner
* Delete tale is separate from stop instance
* Deleting running tale, confirmation would change to "Deleting this tale will stop the running instance"
    * Backend handles stopping and deletion
    * There is an existing event stream, may need some minor updates
* Requires backend work
    * Implementing copy on launch
    * Implement additional attributes (copy)
* Remove "Launched tales" panel from Browse and Run
* Rough estimate?
    * 2 weeks 1 FTE

Refactor Compose to Modal
-------------------------
* Add "Create New Tale" to Browse page
* Implement compose modal
    * Requires "Select Data" modal (same functionality as external_data), however the session doesn't exist yet.
    * Select Data modal needs to output same structure for both compose and running tale cases (see above)
* For now, to be consistent with current UI, create launches tale
    * However, if max instances reached, it should create without launching with sensible message.
* Remove Compose tab
* Rough estimate?
    * 4 days 1 FTE


Edit/view tale metadata
-----------------------
* Add "Metadata" tab to Run page
* Refactor view/edit page
  * Should be able to see DOIs/information of associated data or parent tales
  * If edit access, user can edit tale metadata
      * Change title, authors, categories, description, image
      * Change environment (remix support)
  * User cannot edit:
      * Datasets used is derived from current state of data
          * DOI-level citation or other human-readable format for top-level registered item
          * Requires backend implementation, UI will get a list of strings 
      * Derived from (parent tale)
      * Created
* Rough estimate?
    * 2 days 1 FTE
      

Implement "Home" in Run > Files
-------------------------------
* Move "Home" capability from Manage to Run/Files/Home
* Add ability to copy/move files from home to current workspace
* Rough estimate?
    * 4 days 1 FTE

Add Browse/Environments
-----------------------
* Move environments capability from Manage to Browse/Environments
* Requires look and feel changes to component
* (Will not implement All v My or "Create" yet)
* Rough estimate:
    * 2 days 1 FTE



Future 
======


Extend tale metadata
--------------------
* Change associated publications
* Change license (two licenses -- one for code/data)
  * Requires backend changes
  * Will require changes to publish
* Version?

Extend external_data to support move/rename
-------------------------------------------
* The "Tale-specific data selection" did not include move/rename capability
* This task entails adding the ability to move/rename folders and files in the external data panel.
* After further discussion -- we'll wait for users to request this feature

Add Browse/Catalog
------------------
* Implement Browse/Catalog view
* "All" shows all data available on the WT system
* "My" shows data that I have registered for use in my tales (same as current Manage/Data panel)
* Add Data opens the "Select Data" modal with the ability to register external data. 
* Mockups are insufficient

Other
-------
* Add search box to Select Data modal
* Sharing
* Search environments, tales, catalog to use API (not just in page)
* All environments (blessed) v my environments and adding new environments are still TBD
