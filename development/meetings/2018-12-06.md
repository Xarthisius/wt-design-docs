        * Conform to Dataverse Atom file
        * Conform to DataONE ORE
        * Not completely realated to the serialization format

* Tommy
    * Visit https://dev.nceas.ucsb.edu/view/urn:uuid:df7ccaed-85e1-474f-b5cc-39e160808dee
    * Download All
    * Open folder
    * Navigate to data
    * Open file that starts with `0077302e`
    * View the contents to see how prov looks
    * Prov statements are made with the `prov` namespace
    * Prov was extended with `provone`

    * Upload the prov information the same way as the metadata: follow repository specifics 
* http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/user/dataset-management.html#data-provenance
    * ACTION:
        * Use provR, RDataTracker, NoWorkFlow, recordr, CamFlow to generate prov traces. 
            * Record/document the output format. Is it JSON, JOSN-ld, xml, etc
        * Document how a normal user would create provenance information on DataONE and Dataverse and provide examples
* ProvR
    * https://github.com/ProvTools/provR
    * Can output prov information to a file with `prov.json()`

* recordr
    * https://github.com/NCEAS/recordr
    * Stores information in sqlite database
    * User can create prov, publish the prov+data to DataONE

* NoWorkFlow
    * https://github.com/gems-uff/noworkflow
    * Stores information in sqlite database
    * User can export as prolog facts

* CamFlow
