================================
Kacper, Craig

Development planning
--------------------

* v0.5 released to production, but announcement delayed pending Jetstream/IU deployment problems
  * PR issued to Dataverse but missed 4.10 release (https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/pull/5417)
* v0.6 (tentative)
  * Use case: create a blank tale, add data, upload/create notebook, make public. Another user can run but not edit.
  * Workspace support
  * Ability to select data and modify session (2w)
    * Requires switch from using copy folders and embrace dm
    * Today sessions are created for instances, but should be created for Tales
  * Fix directory structure
    * Requires backend changes and testing
  * Export?
* v0.7 (tentative)
  * Publish/release/immutability
  * Copy on Launch
  * Files and metadata should work regardless of container state
  * Custom environment 


Discussion of sessions
----------------------
* For v0.6, we need to embrace session API
* This raises the question of which copy of data we are using to populate the session (i.e. original catalog, copy user has in data directory)
* Recapping what we do right now:
  * When you register data, we have a flat namespace, we create an entry
  * If it's already registered, we copy it to your data directory
  * Registration creates two entries -- one in the Global catalog, one in your personal space
  * In current system, the user can reorganize and rename data in their personal space, but not global catalog
* When you create the tale, which should we reference -- global or your copy?
    * The session should operate on the catalog directly -- there is no copying data
    * We would still need some way to differentiate between two users that regisitered the same dataset
    * Instead of having a folder structure per user, we could have the user model have a list of registered datasets
* There will be a migration problem, we need to analyze
* Discussed deletion
    * We need the ability to delete datasets directly (DELETE /dataset/{id})
    * We need the ability to implicitly delete/prune datasets during Tale deletion (DELETE /tale/{id}?prune_ds=true). 
        * This should be non-fatal.
    * Deletion cases:
        * User registers dataset then deletes reference to dataset (likely via future "My Catalog" page)
        * User registers dataset, creates Tale
            * Delete dataset fails -- tale is referencing it
            * Delete Tale prompts to ask if the data should also be deleted (Default yes)
        * User registers dataset, creates Tales 1 and 2
            * Delete dataset fails -- tale is referencing it
            * Delete Tale 2 there is no prompt to delete data since it is referenced.
            * Delete Tale 2 then Tale 1, user is prompted
