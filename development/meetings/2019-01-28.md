Mike H.:
 * Wrote documentation on adding new import providers
 * Fix issue of running girder under http

Tommy:
 * Found an issue with the MIMETYPE of files when publishing to dataone
     * DataONE has a list of supported types, when an type that isn't supported is used, the indexer fails to properly complete the indexing process
         * Leads to issues locating & importing published dataserts
         * Fixed with the environment
 * Generalized the way we recognize where a dataset came from (using a folder property rather than a string match)
 * Fixed up the commit logs for `dataone_publishing` in gwvolman, girder_wholetale, and dashboard
 * Publishing feature is up to date across repos except dashboard (the only merge conflict should be in the run page left panel)
 * Had some old testing issues in that I went through (this is when I found the mimetype issue)
 * Joining the prov meetings on Friday to keep up to date on what decisions are made (I'll probably work on implementing this)
 * Finished the repostory for representing exported Tales in RO format
 * Just to note:
     * We specify dataone member nodes via the publish endpoint
     * We specify the CN during server setup as an environmental var
 * Should I remove the data selection on the compose & run page?
     * https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/362
Next: 
        * Fix the mimetype issue
        * Rebase dashboard with master
        * (If gwvolman & girder_wt pass review) test on dev for early validation-it works on my machine?
        * Meet with Craig about format this week?
