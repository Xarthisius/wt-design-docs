Development planning
--------------------

* Release v0.6
    * User registered data in external data
        * My Catalog
        * WT Catalog
        * https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/205
        * https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/357
    * Need some migrations
    * Maybe: Add Select Data button on compose page
* Release v0.7
    * Copy on launch
        * Backend:
            * /tale/{id}/copy
                * Add status
                * Two event statuses -- started, done
        * UI
            * https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/issues/232
            * Basic scenarios:
            * User attempts to launch a tale they do not own (e.g., LIGO)
            * User attempts to launch LIGO tale (or other tale they do not own)
            * User launches LIGO tale
            * Prompt or no prompt
    * Data catalog
    * Compose dialog -- more involved because of 
    * Moving from instance to Tale
        * Stop/start on the Tale card
        * Dropping the "Launched Tales" panel
        * Run Tale context is Tale
    * All Tale v My Tale
