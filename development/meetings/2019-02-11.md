Development planning
--------------------

* Update
* Discussions
    * v0.6 Testing
        * [Test cases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13DmFabJX66iNwWKH-Xpuuam0FcGgnO2AE9h5crdrosA/edit#gid=0)
        * [Previous test cases on GH](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/issues/327)
    * Licensing
        * Open questions
            * Are Tales licensed? Or only at publication?
            * Who is responsible for violation of licenses?
            * Convene "Licensing" task group
            * Are we distributing code other than the WT itself? e.g., GPL
            * What about stata/matlab
    * Tommy -- [whole-tale/girder_wholetale#224](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/issues/224)
        * Prototype export -- is working now with manifest.json
        * Import in progress
        * Created a new publisher model
            * Needed for export, at least for the format as designed
            * 3 URLs -- one for lookup, one for registration, one for publishing
    * Nuest (o2r/ERC), Boettiger, Marwick:

Updates
-------

* Kacper:
    * Workspace endpoint -- finishing touches (both GET /workspace and `workspaceId` in *Tale*)
    * Implemented POST  /tale/{:id}/copy
* Ian:
* Adam:
* Tommy:
    * `GET /manifest` + unit tests
    * Upload zipped Tale to Home
        * Call import with the zipfile id
    * Currently fixing refactor (from gwvolman to girder_wt) road kill
    * Pondered [licenses](https://hackmd.io/ySHK40K8QJCvenxVcgo7OA?both)
    * Importing Status:
        * Was able to re-register datasets that were in the Tale
        * Haven't implemented moving files from the zip to `/home/etc`
        * Testing & making bug fixes in girder_wt
    * KK:
        * Registration should look for manifest.json
        * TT:
            * Should look for manifest when importing from dataset
            * When importing from zip, the import method already knows the manifest exists, so call some sub-process that bypasses the manifest check
    * Issue of licenses came up
        * Need to discuss
        * Example of https://github.com/benmarwick/1989-excavation-report-Madjedbebe
            * Text = CC-By-4.0
            * Data = CC0
            * Code = MIT
* Craig:
    * Dev planning for v0.6 and v0.7
    * PR reviews/testing for v0.6

        * RDA fellows mid-point meetings this week
        * Planning for March RR workshop
