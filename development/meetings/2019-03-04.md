2019-03-04: Development Planning
=================================
Kacper, Craig, Tommy

Discussion with Craig, Kacper:
* v0.6 release
    * v0.6 rc3
        * Running on stage
        * Tale migration is missing
        * Dozens of tales don't migrate cleanly
    * Craig to run migrate script with Girder shell
        * Remember, additional script in girder_wholetale for migrating datasets
    * Final testing
    * Deployment to prod
* Environment customization
    * Merge sooner, even if only partially there
    * User experience won't change, but we need to commit to export format
    * Export issues:
        * Specific configurations:
            * Forked repo2docker/version
            * Template BuildPack
    * Discussed injecting files into the workspace, but opted against for now


Discussion with Craig, Kacper and Tommy
* Status with Tommy
    * Tale serialization format
    * Export proof of concept --> now needs to become reality
        * https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/issues/224
        * Need to resolve issues with placeholders
            * environment.txt
                * We need to resolve what this means and looks like
            * README.txt.tpl
                * Jinja template with Tale JSON to render the right stuff
            * LICENSE
                * Licenses are in Github in gwvolman. Need to do something else
        * Discussions
            * createdBy v author
                * createdBy = Tale creator
                * Authors need to be real authors
                * Follow the Git model -- author v committed
        * BagIt version?
            * /tale/{id}/export?format=zip|bagit
    * Import proof of concept
        * Had it working on datasets, but not the workspace
        * You would upload a Tale to the home directory and given an item id, import it.
        * Hasn't been refactored to use latest PRs
        * Do we import an environment/image that isn't there?
            * Check that fields match
                * BuildPack, Template, urlPat
    * Publish to DataONE
        * Largely as-it-was
        * Refactored to use workspace
        * Refactored filepicker
        * Craig's preference: 
            * Drop the filepicker, drop entypoint selection
* v0.7 release
    * Assume Craig's PRs are merged
        * Environment defined by Image object + workspace
    * Target v0.7 release 
        * NSF panel in 1 month
        * Stage version 1-2 weeks before the review
        * March 22nd

    * Discussion of export endpoint and new repo2docker work
    * /export
        * Manifest()
        * Image + system information (repo2docker version)
        * Tale 
            * repo2docker version
    Other:
        * Author selection via ORCID
        * Keep authors a string and make it editable for now


Priorities (Tommy)
* Author
    * Make author field editable in Dashboard ([PR Here](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/pull/432))
    * Add author field to manifest (it's a string, don't try to parse it for now) (See slack discussion)
* Licence selection
    * Add license field to Tale object
    * Add license endpoint -- for v0.7 list licenses available in the system (DataONE only)
    * Add license files
    * Add license selector to Dashboard (PR for this and items above [PR Here](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/pull/440)
    * Add license to Zip on export 
    * Change export/manifest to no longer take license parameter
* Environment
    * Change https://github.com/whole-tale/gwvolman/pull/43 to add repo2docker version in Tale.imageInfo
    * Export should include environment.json based on Tale:imageInfo and Image information
* Export
    * Add "Export" to Run menu [PR Here](https://github.com/whole-tale/dashboard/pull/434)
* Publish
    * Remove license selection for now
    * Disable filepicker, entrypoint, license selection for v0.7 (license is already selected and valid for DataONE)
