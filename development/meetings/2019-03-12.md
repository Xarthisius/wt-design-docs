=================================
Kacper, Craig, Tommy


* Discussion of whether to include dataset record and isPartOf for HTTP (NO)
* Discussion of need to be able to resolve Dataset for a particular item
    * It's not always the parent or top-level
    * Globus -- it's top level
    * DataONE -- it's the parent, but pay attention to subpackages
    * Proposal: implement method on Provider to get Dataset given an item
* Next steps:
    * Filter out Datasets and isPartOf for HTTP resources
    * Do not enumerate all files in a registered datasets. Only the single selected level.
        * Examples:
            * Selecting usc2005.xls from Humans and Hydrology
            * Select a single compound from Logan's tale (a subfolder)
