Kacper, Craig, Tommy, Mike L

* Dashboard export PR
    * Please prioritize this
    * Need to also handle that we support zip and bagit
    * Use bagit_export:
        * Either as two separate menus or a submenu
        * See https://semantic-ui.com/modules/dropdown.html#pointing
* Publish
    * Need to get this reviewed and merged
    * dashboard
    * girder_wholetale
    * gwvolman
* Discussion of multiple authors
    * Creator/ORCID problem:
        * Creator is relevant for export and publish
        * Stian's RO feedback is to use ORCID for creator
        * In WT creator is Tale creator, and we do not have an ORCID
        * We can have an ORCID
            * Enforce via Globus app configuration
        * This goes into the manifest, which is used in publish
        * Fall back to Globus ID if we don't have an ORCID
            * https://auth.globus.org/v2/api/identities/b9600f5e-2b72-4b37-92af-0ff4d49abc71
    * Authors
        * Authors are relevant for browse/card display, export and publish
        * During initial validation, we're populating the author as the creator
        * Authors have first, last, orcid
        * 1. Leave it blank, but then we can't display the name on the dashboard
        * 2. Make the orcid optional -- but required for publish/export
        * 3. email or orcid
    * Dashboard:
        * Authors widget allows adding first, last, orcid -- all are required
            * To hit save, you have to provide an orcid
            * The first time, no one will have an orcid. Because after migration the creator is the author and we don't have ORCID's today.
    * Export and publish
        * For multiple author
            * ORCID must have been provided
        * For single author legacy tales where the ORCID has not been provided
            * Fall back to Globus ID
    * Multiple author Scenario
        * Craig creates the Bocinsky/Guedes Tale before this feature
        * During validation step, the author is set to Craig with no ORCID
        * Craig edits the metadata, adding Bocinsky and Guedes as authors (Craig is not an author)
        * Because he logged in after the ORCID requirement was enabled, we now have his ORCID for the creator record
        * He had to supply ORCIDs for Bocinsky and Guedes to add multiple authors
* Stian's feedback
