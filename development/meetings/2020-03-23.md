Updates
-------
* Tommy:
    * Vacation this week cancelled (but took Friday off)
    * Moved my office to my house
        * [Battlestation](https://ibb.co/x3SN2RT)
    * Performed testing centered around importing Tales & Datasets on RC3
    * This Week:
        * Fixing my Metacat deployment
        * Get reprozip/provone work in GitHub
        * Stop registering latest version/updated versions of DataONE datasets
        * Scope out bringing in EML from DataONE when registering datasets

* Kacper
    * Tested dashboard-ng a bit
    * Helping with a workshop that uses WT (happening now)

* Mike L
    * Tale sharing UI/API integration complete - PR/test case to follow, slight divergence from mockups
        * Search Girder users, not email address - if an e-mail/invite API already exists, then we could use that instead
        * No mockup for a "group" ACL
        * Gravatar / affiliation / description missing from ACL response
            * CORS errors from hitting the gravatar endpoint directly
        * No notion of user's "affiliation" at all - is this description?
    * Made a PR to address follow-on comments from deploy-dev patterns for ngx-dashboard
    * Starting on Git integration UI pieces

* Tim
    * With Kacper's and Tommy's help got WT running on my local Linux system
    * Working on ideas for EC call for notebooks.  Likely will use SKOPE data sets and processing workflows.

* Elias
    * Worked through user guide. Noticed some minor potential improvements to the documentation. Should I be focusing on improving that or testing the app more?
    * Other tasks?
