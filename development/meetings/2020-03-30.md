* Updates

Updates
-------
* Kacper:
    * worked on other project most of the last week

* Tommy:
    * Had Friday off for Cesar Chavez
    * My DataONE stack is back up and running (major change was exposing metacataui via Apache rather than Tomcat)
        * Will use this to demo DataONE folder structure
        * Will also be used for demoing and testing SDTL display on dataset landing pages
    * Testing RC3
        * Just have Pulishing, Zenodo, & Regressions
    * Created [an issue](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/issues/413) about including the EML on imported DataONE datasets
        * tldr: We should be doing this after/as brown dog is deployed. Bringing in the data is easy, side effects (like publishing is more complex) 
    
* Mike L:
    * Submitted PR for Tale sharing
    * WIP branch for Git integration UI (ready to wire)
    * Updated PR/issue templates in ngx-dashboard
    * Updated issue templates for test plan(s)
    * Currently running v0.9rc3 testing
        * Results to follow
        * Noting that one or more bug fixes are missing from this RC (e.g. multiple files being deleted at once)


* Tim:
    * Can work on queries that produce RDF reports (JSON-LD?) from the provenance captured by ReproZip.
    * If there are examples of what is needed by DataONE can use these as targets.

* Elias:
    * Working mostly on COVID-19 stuff @ TACC

* Craig
    * BD converter for sdtl-converter (demonstrated last week)
        * Agreed to implement other converters, issue relevant PRs
    * Presented WT integration on PresQT community call today
        * We wouldn't even consider using it without improved metadata support
