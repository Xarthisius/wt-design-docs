    * Tagged, released and deployed v0.9
        * A lot of things had to be cleaned up after CCA workshop...
    * Testing new dashboard 

* Tim
    * With Tommy's guidance assembled queries of the WT prov model that output JSON-LD representations of PROV and ProvONE describing a single execution as a whole.
    * Hoping to get more elaborate examples working (contributed by Tommy) and start incorporating YesWorkflow and maybe C2Metadata.
    * Maybe create visualizations of PROV/ProvONE of our own (that make PROV gurus happy, and Bertram happy)

   * Last week: 
       * primarily spent time on PR review, testing, for v0.9
   * This week: 
       * C2metadata/BD converter
       * PresQT task wrap-up
       * New UI feedback
   * Note: 
       * Will likely convert to hourly to remain involved with WT after 4/30. Not rid of me yet.

    * Did some c2metadata work with Tim
    * This week I'll be working on demoing the folder structure in DataONE and adding piecewise to my metadata example
