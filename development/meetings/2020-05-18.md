Updates
-------

* Kacper
    * Reviews

* Tommy
    * Got ngx-dashboard after last week's meeting
        * Dashboard PRs
    * Presented the ProvONE stuff on last Thursday's meeting
        * Recieved good feedback
            * Need a way to validate it
    * Friday's Prov Call
        * Idea of badges came up again
            * There's an online [badge turf war](https://groups.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/23561/RP-31-202X_Reproducibility_Badging_draft_for_public_comment.pdf) going on.
            * About 1/4 of the way done with a design document that outlines what it would take for WT to align with one of the badge specifications (could be out of scope, but would put the badge discussion to an end)
                * Open to discussion at the end of the call
    * Next up
        * Finish [this](https://github.com/NCEAS/metacat/pull/1414) metacat PR
        * Get a new build of d1_python
        * Follow up emails from C2metadata meeting
        * If there aren't any requests, then fix [this](https://github.com/DataONEorg/d1_python/issues/28) issue that's preventing us from updating Tales that were published to DataONE

* Craig
    * C2Metadata:
        * Joined call last week, have next action for BD integration
        * Met with STATA and MathWorks reps
            * STATA offered similar arrangement as with CO -- free licenses in return for acknowledgement of support
            * MathWorks will get back sometime this week. In the meantime, we can likely legitimately use the Jetstream licenses.
    * Did not get to PRs or versioning work, but fog is clearing this week

* Mike L
    * PR for Export Tale fix
    * Attempted to fix AiWT, but ran into some DOI resolution failures
        * See [stack trace](https://gist.github.com/bodom0015/9bf5cdc2c292b2b32f079e09d7e87d7e)
        * Dataverse JSON missing, so resolutions currently failing - awaiting deploy-dev workaround

* Mike H
    * Addressed the feedback from last week

* Tim
    * Need to move closer to implementation on the provenance work to get ready for SKOPE implementation and potential new projects.
    * Looking into graph databases that support SPARQL and/or Gremlin as potential provenance stores.
    * Blazegraph looks promising--supports both SPARQL and Gremlin.
    * Inspired by Tommy's work with JSON-LD representations of PROV and ProvONE--made me take another look at SPARQL.
