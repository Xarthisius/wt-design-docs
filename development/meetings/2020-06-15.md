    * https://ischool.illinois.edu/news-events/events/2020/06/15/dissertation-defense-craig-willis
        * Congrats! 

* Tommy
    * A little C2Metadata work on looking at the queries that C2Metadata wants and doing an eyeball look at the propsed/current data model
    * Tiny bit of Metacat work
    * Looking at issue that's preventing package obsoletion via WT

* Mike H


* Mike L
    * Thinking about View Logs modal and the blank logs/endless spinner issue - only pull first job log (as Ember did) or concat and show logs for all related jobs?
        * Kacper suggests the latter, may need propering sorting/ordering (possibly based on creation timestamp?)
        * Would `_id` be sufficient for this?
    * Added "popout" icon to `tale-interact` tab (PR pending)
        * Down a rabbit hole of trying to improve start/stop notifications on the `tale-interact` tab
        * "Stopping Tale" message is an odd case that is presenting problems, so may need supplemental work later 


* Tim
    * Made a little progress exercising the SPARQL HTTP interface to Blazegraph.
    * Working on extracting query results from JSON-LD returned from requests.
    * Next step is automating loading data into a Blazegraph instance.
