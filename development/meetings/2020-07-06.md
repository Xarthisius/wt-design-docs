2020-07-06: Development Meeting
===============================

Kacper, Tommy, Mike L, Mike H, Tim, Craig

Agenda
------
* Updates
* Matlab and Stata
    * How to handle multiple versions of base images (e.g. bazillion of Matlabs)
        * 1) Ubuntu LTS + r2d, then install Matlab/Stata in the image
            * Q: Do Matlab/Stata need external installable software (like python)? YES
            * https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile
                * `#RUN ln -s ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /lib64/ld-lsb-x86-64.so.3` -- seriously?!
        * Craig to explore building tarballs containing /usr/local/MATLAB for each version/LTS
            * r2d Matlab buildback + runtime.txt support
            * Store tarballs somewhere (Ubuntu_18.04-Matlab_R2020a.tar)

Updates
-------

* Kacper:
    * PR reviews

* Tommy
    * Friday call
        * Nothing incredibly note-worthy
    * Prepping for C2Metadata meeting this week
        * Finishing up prov documents (need to make sure current examples have retrospective prov)
        * Trying to finish queries up
    * Had to slightly refactor `datapack` PR (used for testing DataONE file structure stuff) 
    * Looked again at upping d1_python version in girder_wholetale *again*
    * Source code error in d1_common; I'm guessing that it's a language version difference? Need to double check
        * Poked the issue for someone to cut the d1_python release again so that we can document file locations from WT
        * Maintainer *should* be cutting the release sometime this week

* Mike L
    * PR for several file-related issues
        * 400 on file upload
        * files couldn't be downloaded/removed immediately after upload, needed refresh
        * 400 on adding external data
        * display issues for external data
        * Create Folder was creating in the wrong folder
        * Register Dataset should auto-select first search result
    * Addressed feedback on other PR
        * Fixed issue with folder download on Run > Metadata > Involatile Data
        * Fixed minor typo in the `buildImage` notification resource
        * Restart Tale has no logs - not sure how to handle this in the UI side. Hard to tell whether logs are empty or request is still pending
            * We could just add a notification saying "Restarting..." and that might suffice?
        * Can't reproduce View Logs "Close" button issue

* Tim
    * I think I finally know what needs to be done to integrate Blazegraph with the current approach to extracting provenance information from ReproZip's outputs.
    * Will try to get import from datalog-style facts working this week, and dump back to same.

* Craig
    * Matlab: May need no additional permissions given license
        * https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/master/LICENSE.md
    * Migrating to personal laptop
    * Writing NSF one-pagerS

* Mike H
    * Working on versioning + meta design doc
