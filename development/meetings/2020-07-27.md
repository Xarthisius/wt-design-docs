Updates
-------

* Kacper
    * Met with Kyle and Mingzhe to talk about proper Deriva integration
    * Out sick most of the week

* Tommy
    * Debugged a VM issue with Kacper
    * Tested updated base image
        * Need to file dashboard issue for broken modal on settings page
        * Need to test Zenodo (can use API instead of dashboard)
        * Need to test Importing from DataONE (There was an issue with dev dataone deployments last week)
    * Completed instructions for generating prov from SDTL
        * Should send these off at the end of the day or tomorrow for comment
    * Friday prov call
        * Looked at how WT might help researchers meet particular journal requirements for documentation (prov stuff) and other metrics
    * Update packages in Wt
        * Created a PR for the fix
            * It follows the DataONE standard, but breaks other use cases
            * Refactored to not follow the spec, but allows for the use cases (requested change by DataONE)
                * Might _still_ break some of their use cases
            * Might just leave the bug and fix from the Whole Tale side

* Mike L
    * Updated PR with fixes for select-data-modal
    * Fixed an issue with the "Ack All" button in the notification-stream
        * Clicking ack would prevent future events from coming through
    * Tested [an old WIP PR](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/326) for data registration as a job - appears to work as intended :+1:

* Craig
    * NSF one pager for verification workflow
    * BrownDog converters for sdtl-reader and dataset-updater (C2Metadata)
    * Testing MATLAB image build process
        * Kitchen sink (25GB image) v customization (4GB image MATLAB only)

* Tim
    * Working with the JSON-LD files Tommy created for the SDTL-PROVONE integration.
    * Blank nodes cause some difficulties with repeatability of outputs.
    * Will be working on provenance queries this week.

* Mike H
    * out on vacation
