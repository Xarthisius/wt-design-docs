2020-08-31: Development Meeting
===============================

Kacper, Mike L, Tim, Tommy

Agenda
------
* Updates
* Updated Tales discussion
    * Held off on demoing until [this](https://github.com/whole-tale/ngx-dashboard/issues/95) issue is resolved
    * Consider the use case: Someone publishes a Tale, includes it in their paper. Then they go ahead and fork the Tale (/continue to work on it) to do more research. They publish to DataONE, but their original published object will be obsoleted-breaking the link to the first paper.
    * Matt suggested some sort of UI element when publishing to let the user decide when its appropriate to update a published Tale
        * If the Tale has been published to Zenodo or DataONE, let the user know that it's been published and they have the ability to update it, but dont't have to

* publishInfo ordering
    * Should only keep one record for each publisher and update

Updates
-------

* Mike L
    * PR for Run > Metadata styling and missing fields
        * Should add back "edit mode" or some way to preview rendered view
    * PR for MoveTo dialog
        * pitfall: changing `parentId` is a no-op unless `parentType` is included, even if `parentType` is unchanged
        * 500 error when moving between Home <-> Tale Workspaces - this is a [known bug](https://github.com/whole-tale/wt_home_dirs/issues/26)
    * Merged Tommy's PR :+1:

* Tim
    * Some improvements to SPARQL reporter.
    * Working on CIRSS development.  Will be factoring code into CIRSS-wide, SKOPE-specific and WT-specific capabilities.

* Kacper
    * Dashboard reviews
    * Hotfixing py37 merge mess
    * Preparing to integrate versioning:
        * First step: HomeDirs to use virtual resources.

* Tommy
    * Dashboard PR
    * Fiddled with the COGS system
        * Gross dependancies, environment assumptions
        * Still couldn't get it to fully work-requesting the OWL file instead
    * Discussed more use cases for obsoleting (see agenda)
        * Ran across a small UI bug (not implimented in previous dashboard) related to ordering
