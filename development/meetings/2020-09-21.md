        * KK: Try:
          ```
          pip install pipenv --user
          pipenv --python 3.8  # any >=3.6 should work too
          pipenv install
          pipenv run pip install -e .
          pipenv run pytest --cov=gwvolman .
          ```
    * Spliting the tests out of the Tale Update PR
    * Worked on recorded run documentation (mostly updating and expanding on older docs)
        * Storing prov in Blazegraph vs text file
        * Flow diagrams for the recorded run and publishing
        * Touched up the provenance tooling output doc

* Tim
    * Mostly worked on grant proposals.
    * Built a [statically linked ReproZip executable](https://github.com/CIRSS/reprozip-static) for 64-bit Linux.  Interestingly, traces using this sees fewer files (libraries) accessed during a run.  Need to investigate.
