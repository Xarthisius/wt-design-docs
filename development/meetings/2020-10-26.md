2020-10-26: Development Meeting
===============================

Kacper, Tommy, Craig, Mike L, Mike H.

Agenda
------
* Updates
* No dev call next week (11/02) ([name=Kacper])
* Default ORCID behavior ([name=Tommy])
    * Related to last week's discussion of [this](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/412) PR
    * Behavior is looking more like...
        * If the user is connected to an ORCID and creates a new Tale, add their ORCID
        * If the user creates a Tale while _not_ connected to ORCID, leave it blank
        * If the user has a Tale and connects an ORCID, do not modify the Tale author fields
            * First problem is determining which Tale to modify
            * Second is determining which author to modify
* [FAIR Convergence Symposium 2020](https://conference.codata.org/FAIRconvergence2020/)
    * WholeTale: Implementation of Provenance Queries (TBD) ([name=Tommy])
        * Any ideas about what this might be?
* Should we plan a release? ([name=Craig])
    * YES!
    * Mid-Decemberish
    * Kacper's update from Exec call last week:
        * Applied for a new allocation on Jetstream for 2021.

Updates
-------
* Tommy
    * More C2Metadata
        * I don't think that the SDTL owl file is correct/has ever been used (see incorrect 'range' for lists in the owl file)
            * Issues where lists (mergesDataFrames:["dframe1, dframe2"]) have no defined representation in RDF
            * Proposing a way to do this with Dan
                * I'm not really concerned with what SDTL looks like in RDF so I'm creating an object for each string, with type schema:Thing and schema:name "dframe1"
    * PR reviews

* Craig:
    * Matlab PRs ready for review, I hope...
        * [Deploy-dev Matlab support](https://github.com/whole-tale/deploy-dev/pull/39) (primary test case)
        * New repo [matlab-install](https://github.com/whole-tale/matlab-install)
        * [repo2docker: Buildkit and build-args](https://github.com/whole-tale/repo2docker/pull/3)
        * [repo2docker_wholetale: Matlab buildkit](https://github.com/whole-tale/repo2docker_wholetale/pull/14)
        * [gwvolman: Matlab support](https://github.com/whole-tale/gwvolman/pull/117)
    * Back to C2Metadata before next call

* Kacper
    * no updates this week

* Mike H

* Mike L
    * Wired up the version timeline in the Versions side panel in the UI
    * Expanded Client API to handle get / getRoot / list / delete, in addition to create
    * Filed a bug about delete case, which throws a stack trace: https://github.com/whole-tale/wt_versioning/issues/6
