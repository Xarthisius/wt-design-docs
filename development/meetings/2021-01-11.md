2021-01-11: Development Meeting
===============================

Kacper, Craig, Tommy, Mike L, Tim, Mike H

Agenda
------
* Updates
* Recorded run -- [name=Craig]
    * [Draft tracking issue](https://github.com/whole-tale/whole-tale/issues/88)
        * Feedback welcome
        * Need to create sub-issues
    * [Current recorded run structure](https://github.com/whole-tale/wt_versioning/blob/master/server/resources/run.py#L241-L266)
    * Current implementation
        * API is partially complete (create, list, rename, delete, stream stderr/out). Actual run implementation is not done.
        * Assumes results folder and .stderr/stdout written to run top level directory 
        * During run, workspace is a pointer to an immutable version
    * Current structure
        * tale (order conceptually, not alphabetically)
            * data (externally registered data)
            * workspace
            * versions
                * v1
                    * data
                    * workspace
            * runs
                * r1
                    * data/ (link to ../versions/v1/data)
                    * results/ (output from run)
                    * workspace/ (link to ../versions/v1/workspace)
                    * version/ (link to ../versions/v1/)
                    * .stderr
                    * .stdout
    * Discussion of "results" directory
        * Can the tale write into the workspace?
        * Assumes output written to ../results folder
        * Writing to workspace presents problem (what if they modify the src code as part of the run?)
    * Discussion of export/import
        * Two options: 
            * Export run/version as current tale (adds results and stderr/out files)
            * Export run/version structure (adds notion of version and run along with results and stderr/out)
        * Example: Exported tale with current structure from the run/version -- including results and stdout/err, which must be reimported without creating a version or run 
            * tale (v1)
                * data/ (bagit...)
                    * data/ 
                        * dataone.csv
                    * workspace/
                        * run.sh
                        * my.py
                    * results/
                        * my.out
                    * .stderr
                    * .stdout
        * Example: Exported tale with the run/version structure
            * tale
                * data
                    * dataone.csv
                * workspace
                    * run.sh
                    * my.py
                * versions
                    * v1
                        * data
                            * dataone.csv
                        * workspace
                            * run.sh
                            * my.py
                * runs
                    * run1
                        * data (link to Versions/v1/data)
                        * results
                            * my.out
                        * version (link to Versions/v1)
                        * workspace (link to Versions/v1/workspace)
                        * .stderr
                        * .stdout
        * Discussion about "data"
            * There is ongoing confusion about the ../data directory and what it's used for (external data v my data)
        * Discussion about "workspace" name
            * There is ongoing confusion about the workspace (tale directory or scratch space?)

Updates
-------

* Kacper

        * Adding tests [wt_versioning#13](https://github.com/whole-tale/wt_versioning/pull/13)
        * Handling metadata - in works
        * Restoring - in works

* Craig
    * Versioning PR review + testing
    * MATLAB "Web Desktop" POC
        * They publicly released https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-integration-for-jupyter/ 
    * Submitted proposal to IBM for SPSS support
        * Appear to require site license for SPSS, which none of our partners support
    * Began drafting Recorded Run issues
    * Traefik for CSP

* Tommy
    * Back from vacation
    * Two PRs for Tale Sharing & Git Integration
        * Addressed first round of feedback

* Tim
    * Close to having a query that produces a variable-level dataflow diagram from SDTL RDF.
        * Had to add rule-like SPARQL macro capability to Geist.
        * Note how `sdtl_select_variable_write_read_edges` uses `upstream_variable_writer` (defined above the former) three times:  [sdtl.g](https://github.com/CIRSS/geist/blob/1a8f4705ee51db00b9aff72733ee91f4fa305ae6/examples/common/sdtl.g#L209)
        * Will be useful to generating ports and channels for ProvONE export via CONSTRUCT query.
        * Will prettify the Geist "rule" syntax to look more like SPARQL.
    * Ready to customize CPR and Geist as needed for Whole Tale.
