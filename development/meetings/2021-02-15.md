    * Interested in supporting remote contexts in standards-compliant ways that do not require resolving remote URLs at run (load or query) time.

* Mike L
    * Reviewed PRs
    * Added some bits to UI PR for "Restore Version"
        * There doesn't seem to be a way to restore to HEAD atm, but that seems like the only missing piece :+1:
    * Fixed UI version name validation race condition in "Rename" case
        * Sorry for the extraneous PR here, I missed a comment where the last issue was addressed
    * Thinking about Craig's WIP for event updates
        * May need some small service in the UI to distribute updates to interested components
