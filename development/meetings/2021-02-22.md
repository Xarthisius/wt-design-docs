2021-02-22: Development Meeting
===============================

Kacper, Mike H, Tommy, Tim

Agenda
------
* Updates
* Auto generated versions 
    * Create new version on _every_ export/publish or only when one is missing

Updates
-------

* Kacper
    * Merged all the things! (version restore, partial support for versions in export/publish)
    * Reviewing Tommy's work.

* Craig
    * PR review/testing

* Tommy
    * Exporting & Publishing Versions work
        * Addressing Kacper's feedback about version requirements in the Manifest
        * Fixed up gwvolman tests
        * Will write wt_versioning tests after agenda discussion
        * Followed by girder_wt tests
    * Other general DataONE related testing
        * Found that analyzing published Tales is restrictive in the search for Tales in the system (many Tales weren't found)
        * Expect to see PR for that fix soon
    * SDTL stuff
        * George confirmed ~5 or so commands look good in linked data form
        * The different parsers produce slightly different JSON output (my converter parses that JSON) so some things broke. George has a work around, low priority but done before prov week
    * End of lifetime
        * My WT time has been ramping down, ends this week
        * I still have some recorded run work to do, so I'll be spending a little time this week looking at geist and a PoC of instering the provone output into resource maps

* Tim
    * Cleaned up Blazegraph CLI and got it closer to feature complete, help, etc.
    * Still need to add a --wait flag to the status command, for waiting until Blazegraph is up and running.

* Mike H
    *
