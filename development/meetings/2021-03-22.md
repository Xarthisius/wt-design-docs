            * currently homes and workspaces all point to the same place:
              ```
                {
                    "Type": "bind",
                    "Source": "/mnt/homes",
                    "Target": "/tmp/wt-home-dirs"
                },
                {
                    "Type": "bind",
                    "Source": "/mnt/homes",
                    "Target": "/tmp/wt-tale-dirs"
                },
              ```
            * proposition
                * in /mnt/homes create workspaces/ homes/ versions/ runs/. Move {5,6} to workspaces/ everything else to homes/ 
                * mount /mnt/homes as /tmp/data or something similar, adjust paths in wt_home_dirs plugins
    * 
* Notifications PR [name=Mike L]
    * Lots of behaviorial changes to consider here
    * We might consider pushing this to next release so that we can think more about side-effects
