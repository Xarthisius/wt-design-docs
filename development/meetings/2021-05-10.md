Updates
-------

* Kacper
  * Various fixes continued:
    * Fixed copying virt_objs in place -- [virtual_objects#14](https://github.com/whole-tale/virtual_resources/pull/14)
    * Verify validity of D1 JWT -- [girder_wholetale#475](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/475)
    * Preserve ctime/mtime of copied versions -- [wt_versioning#26](https://github.com/whole-tale/wt_versioning/pull/26)
  * PR reviews

* Tim
    * Discovered [prov:Bundle](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/#Bundle) which is meant to enable the provenance of provenance to be declared.
    * A hole in prov:Bundle is it prescribes no method for associating (via RDF) triples that are meant to be in the bundle with the bundle.
    * Blazegraph supports the RDF* ([RDF-star and SPARQL-star W3C community report](https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/cg-spec/2021-04-13.html)) extension which seems to be cleanest way of declaring and querying (with SPARQL*) the provenance of provenance.
