2021-09-13: Development Meeting
===============================
Kacper, Mike L, Mike H, Craig, Tim

Agenda
------
* Updates
* Recorded Runs UI preview ([name=Mike L])
    * WIP - rename/remove buttons exist, but need to use different endpoints at the top-level (see existing rename/delete version)
    * WIP - rename/remove should not be allowed outside of the top level
    * BUG - Names shouldn't be required. looking into backend solution. Possibly a bug in Girder itself and their swagger parsing/generation?
    * Would be nice to show Run Status next to each Run - see [RunStatus](https://github.com/whole-tale/wt_versioning/blob/master/server/constants.py#L24-L30)

    * Now have bpftrace program that monitors the full lifecycle of Linux processes.  It's small and looks like an awk script:
        ```
        #!/usr/bin/env bpftrace
        
        BEGIN {
            printf("------------------ Starting bpftrace -------------------\n");
            printf("\n");
            printf("  TIME(us)    EVENT   PROCESS  PROGRAM NAME     DETAILS\n");
            printf("  --------    -----   -------  ------------     -------\n");
        }

        tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_clone /args->ret != 0/ {
            printf("%10u    %-6s %8d  %-15s  child=%d\n", elapsed/1000, "start", 
                   pid, comm, args->ret);
        }

        tracepoint:syscalls:sys_enter_execve {
            printf("%10u    %-6s %8d  %-15s  argv=", elapsed/1000, "exec", pid, comm); 
            join(args->argv); 
        }

        tracepoint:sched:sched_process_exit {
            printf("%10u    %-6s %8d  %-15s \n", elapsed/1000, "exit", pid, comm);
        }

        END {
            printf("\n------------------ Exiting bpftrace -------------------\n");
        }
        ```
    * Output when monitoring the `date` command issued at the bash prompt:
        ```
        $ time sudo ./scripts/watch_process_lifecycle.bt 
        Attaching 5 probes...
        ------------------ Starting bpftrace -------------------

        TIME(us)    EVENT   PROCESS  PROGRAM NAME     DETAILS
        --------    -----   -------  ------------     -------
         1599700    clone    121947  bash             child=128934
         1599930    exec     128934  bash             argv=date
         1601748    exit     128934  date   
        ------------------ Exiting bpftrace -------------------
        ```
    * Less than 30% overhead vs a 25x slowdown for ReproZip on the Jupyter notebook I'm using to stress test recording of traces.
    * Negligible overhead if don't monitor process exits (ReproZip does not).
    * Is compiled and runs in the Linux kernel--so can run the bpftrace program in one container and processes you want to monitor in another--no need to give special capabilities to the latter (i.e. the WT user's tale).
    * Also have a working script that shows how to start a bpftrace program in background, wait for it start recording, run some other script, and then shutdown the bpftrace program--will still see all targeted events in the kernel, not just child processes. 
    * Can collect trace in kernel and output back to user space afterwards; can output as triples directly.
    * Will look into recording I/O this week; then interprocess communication (e.g. pipes between parent and child processes such as a Jupyter cell gathering stdout from an external command).
