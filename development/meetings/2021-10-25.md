Updates
-------
* Kacper
    * [Always use dataSet for initializing session](https://github.com/whole-tale/gwvolman/pull/157) - needed for dataDir support, since with girder_wholetale#502 `dataSet` only exists as a backward compatibility layer
    * [Only owner should be able to delete version/run](https://github.com/whole-tale/wt_versioning/pull/36) - per discussion with ODUM

* Craig
    * Out for part of last week
    * PR testing/review
    * Proposal preparation
    * VW supplement dev communications

* Mike H

* Tim
    * Moved to a lower-level approach bypassing bpftrace.
        * The bcc python package provides a means to explicitly divide the user-space and kernel-space parts of a BPF-based application; the two parts are implemented in Python and C respectively.
        * Gives us a couple ways around the 200-character limit on captured function arguments, e.g. the path to open calls.
        * More complex than bpftrace programs but far more flexible.
