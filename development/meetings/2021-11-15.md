Agenda
------
* Updates
* Agenda
    * Let user manually manage image builds?
        * Tale > Metadata > "Advanced" (hidden by default)
        * Stretch goal: some indicator for "out-of-sync" would be helpful
    * Revisiting Recorded Runs design
        * Takeaways:
            * Modify Tale History panel for read-only (except Restore)
            * Add "View Info" to Runs dropdown on Tale History panel 
                * Should this show logs? Output files?
            * Replace entrypoint input with a modal

Updates
-------

* Craig
    * Proposal work
    * PR review/etc.
    * Supplement support

* Kacper
    * Working on better image building

* Mike H
    * DERIVA PRs are ready for the review

* Tim
    * Refactoring "bpfr" (bpf-recorder) to make it easy to turn and off particular probes, add new probes. 
    * Close to adding option to output triples for loading into Blazegraph.
    * Found papers using eBPF heavily for many purposes (security, provenance, debugging distributed systems) and demonstrating it can do other things we need:
        * monitor network connections made and used by a process tree
        * see data passed over UNIX pipes
    * Now thinking we should skip over ReproZip in WT releases.
        * ptrace is considered harmful/"dangerous" in production environments

* Mike L
    * Starting to think about folder uploads
        * Will likely use [ngx-dropzone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-dropzone) or similar
        * Alternatively, there is [a framework agnostic approach](https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2018/01/03/folder-upload-in-an-angular-app/)
    * Question on Recorded Runs design
        * Should we consolidate things?
