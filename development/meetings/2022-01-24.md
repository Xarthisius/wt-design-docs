    * Looking into screen reader support
        * Semantic UI supports this out of the box
        * gotcha: dropdown menus - buttons vs links
        * all-in-all, as someone who doesn't use a screen reader often, I would likely use different patterns than those hwo use them long-term
        * would it be appropriate to ask the vision-impaired user to test the platform for accessibility using their screen reader savvy?

* Tim
    * Bridged SDTL to ProvONE sufficiently to focus on WT-specific provenance and have our queries and reports apply to SDTL-sourced provenance.
    * Paying off massive amounts of technical debt
