    * Import zip/bdbag (below)
        * Recall https://hackmd.io/KQ9TzJ7zSrqzaeYGX9ClSQ
        * Each tale would have its own data folder
            * Whether raw bytes or registered
        * KK: Doesn't need to be part of this release
            * Solves user problems for non-standard providers
            * e.g., Census data, OpenICPSR, yt data
            * That the catalog goes away isn't central to the PRs
        * MH: Is anyone doing real analysis on external data?
            * Short answer, no.
        * KK: Major change
            * There would be raw data in data directory that only lives in WT
        * CW: UI Changes?
            * Import bdbag
    * Folder uploads (unlikely -- should be 1.1.x or 1.2)
* Catalog (import zip/bdbag) [name=Craig]
    * Users of registered data 
        * On production, 435 out of 2311 have non-empty dataSet
        * Of these, the vast majority are tutorials, classes, or tests from internal folks or known collaborators. ~40 with unrecognized names, but could be SGCI usability tests or NCEAS
    * [WIP Revamp dataSet in Tales to account for raw data](https://github.com/whole-tale/girder_wholetale/pull/502)
    * [Always use dataSet for initializing session](https://github.com/whole-tale/gwvolman/pull/157)
    * [Version/restore tale data dirs](https://github.com/whole-tale/wt_versioning/pull/32)
    * [Import bdbag + fix log levels](https://github.com/whole-tale/ngx-dashboard/pull/225)
