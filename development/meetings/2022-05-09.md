    * Saw Kacper's feedback on folder upload
        * base64 virtual IDs don't work well as HTML an ID
        * Is it valid to just remove special chars (e.g. "=")?
        * Are there length restrictions in place here? Apparently not - modern browsers can handle IDs with at least 1M chars

* Mike

* Tim
    * We managed to get the DOE pre-application in
    * Interesting use for provenance of the data-lineage variety: 
        * ML models trained on provenance records
        * Predictions of data to prefetch and speculatively preprocess to lower latencies
    * Back to provenance stuff and making it easy for others to try out the eBPF stuff, until we hear about the pre-application
    * Will be trying out Parsl with an eye to recoding data lineage for executions of processes start Bash Apps
