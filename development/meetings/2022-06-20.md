2022-06-20 Development Meeting
==============================
Craig, Kacper, Tim, Sara

Agenda
------
* Updates
* Recorded Run + ebpf -- [name=Tim]:
    * Proposal: representing the run as a single box
        * These were the files that were read, these were the files that were written
    * Can't make definite statements about other interactions, network connectivity, etc.
    * Can make statements about
* R2D configuration UI -- [name=Craig]
    * From proposal: "We anticipate the following specific changes to the WT platform based on preliminary feedback form Odum and LDI...Improved user experience for customization of software dependencies."
    * Lars: "Students like WholeTale, but are stumped as soon as it gets a bit more technical (installing a Linux package, say). Having a light-weight config panel/ GUI component to create and edit repo2docker config files would be really useful. That being said, I showed one student how to create an apt.txt in the right location, and how to rebuild a tale. It was all a bit mysterious to her, but it worked fine."
    * How to proceed...?
        * Determine what's configurable via R2D
        * Discussion about whether we can edit directly as well as through UI
        * Advanced section
        * What if R2D changes supported files?
        * 
        * ```GET tale/:id/config - returns {"apt":{"ppas":[],"packages":{"vim":"latest"}},"conda": {"channels":[],"packages":{"numpy":"latest"}},...}```
