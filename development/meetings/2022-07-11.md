* Sara
    * Working on 'public' access to dashboard

* Tim
    * Working on enabling automatic testability of provenance recording 
        * With so many moving parts (CPR, Blazegraph, Geist, SPARQL queries and reports, eBPF, Docker, etc), it's critical to ensure that changes don't break things that already work.
        * Logging the activity of the framework itself (and of the REPRO framework itself) runs into the issues the TRACE project is meant to address.
        * Viewing the details of an execution trace in a way that is repeatable despite process ID and timing differences from run to run.
    * Will we have permament URLs for Tales that that are independent of the API?
