        * Need for SDTL-ProvONE paper demos so that we have PROV-compatible traces to go with the SDTL, to demonstrate capabilities of the different provenance models and to query together.
        * Need for the SKOPE data preparation workflows we will be turning into REPROs.
        * Will use the working ReproZip-based recorder for now and swap in the eBPF recorder later.
