What is a "Tale"?
=================

Whole Tale defines a model for reproducibility that captures the input, 
output, data, code, execution environment, methods, provevance and other
metadata about a particular research activity within the system. We refer
to this as a **Tale** -- a composite research object that includes environment
configuration, metadata, data objects (or references to objects) and other
outputs needed to fully reproduce a computational result.

Having created a Tale, a researcher will be able to share it with others, 
publish it to a repository, associate a persistent identifier, and link 
it to publications.  Other researchers can instantiate a version of the Tale 
and execute it in the same state as it was when published. Tales also contain 
intellectual property metadata with licensing information crucial to enabling 
re-use, reproducibility, giving credit, as well as for broad access.
