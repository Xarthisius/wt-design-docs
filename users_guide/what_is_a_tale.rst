What is a "Tale"?
=================

Whole Tale defines a model for reproducibility that captures the input, 
output, data, code, execution environment, methods, provenance and other
metadata about a particular research activity within the system. We refer
to this as a **Tale** -- a composite research object that includes environment
configuration, metadata, data objects (or references to objects) and other
outputs needed to fully reproduce a computational result.

Having created a Tale, a researcher will be able to share it with others, 
publish it to a repository, associate a persistent identifier, and link 
it to publications.  Other researchers can instantiate a version of the Tale 
and execute it in the same state as it was when published. Tales also contain 
intellectual property metadata with licensing information crucial to enabling 
re-use, reproducibility, giving credit, as well as for broad access.

The Whole Tale simplifies data-driven and computational research while making
scholarly activities more reproducible. While using their favorite environment
(e.g., Jupyter, RStudio, etc.) from a web browser, researchers can conduct
analysis on remotely accessible data without the complexities of installing
and managing software packages locally. Future researchers benefit from having
access to the same computational environment to explore and reproduce published
works.
